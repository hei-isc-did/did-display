Use this signal in your design such that when it is '1', all your counters/logic fire sooner.
Otherwise, you will have to simulate for much longer.

When developing, the first time you flash the FPGA to test your circuit, display a still color on
the output to ensure your timings are all OK and leave the below blocks on the side.
Check the screen recognized resolution and frequency.

Then, use this block. It contains data for a picture.
To use it, delete the yellow block named EB1 and feed it the signals pixelPosX and pixelPosY.
It expects values from 0 to 639 for X, and 0 to 479 for Y (the true pixel location of the image).
!!! Be sure to change the Y value only once per line, not resetting it to 0 or other values inbetween. Else the image may give wrong pixel data. !!! 
Flash your project and check if the picture is still and not distorted.

Finally, create a custom image by yourself, made of logic (with state machines, counters ...)
and NOT by simply replacing the image file in the vgaDataCreator block.
This should show all possible colors on screen in a TV test card fashion.

Once you have tested your own block, you can display both your calculated picture and the one generated
by the vgaDataCreator by e.g. switching source when the user clicks on a button.
