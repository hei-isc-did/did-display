Use this signal in your design such that when it is '1', all your counters/logic fire sooner.
Otherwise, you will have to simulate for much longer.

When developing, the first time you flash the FPGA to test your circuit, display a still color on
the output to ensure your timings are all OK and leave the below blocks on the side.

Only then, use this block. It contains data for a picture.
To use it, remove the yellow block named EB1 and feed it the signals pixelPosX and pixelPosY.
It expects values from 0 to 639 for X, and 0 to 479 for Y (the true pixel location of the image).
Flash your project and check if the picture is still and not distorted.
Else, your counters may be desynchronizing and you will have to fix them.

Finally, you have to create a custom image by yourself, made of logic (with state machines, counters ...)
and NOT by simply replacing the image file in the vgaDataCreator block.

Once you have tested your own block, you can display both your calculated picture and the one generated
by the vgaDataCreator by e.g. switching source when the user clicks on a button.
