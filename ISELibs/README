# Unisim lib
The Unisim lib is mandatory for the DCM (which creates the pixelClk) to work.

## Install
By default, the lib is installed on laboratory computers.

If needed, one can build them by running **compxlib**.

Else, while using the same tools as in labs, the zip content can be put under **C:\eda\Xilinx\14.7\ISE_DS\ISE\vhdl\xst\nt64\unisim**.
